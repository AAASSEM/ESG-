### 1. Context
Design a responsive web SaaS called “ESG Compass” that helps UAE small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) understand, track, and report their Environmental, Social and Governance metrics without jargon. Regulatory drivers include Dubai Sustainable Tourism (DST), Green Key, UAE Federal Climate Law, and the Net-Zero 2050 agenda.

### 2. Description (Goals & UX Priorities)
• Ultra-simple language—no “Scope 2” wording; ask users plain-English questions (e.g., “Do you buy electricity from DEWA at this site?”).  
• Wizard-first onboarding (4 steps) with progressive disclosure to minimise initial cognitive load.  
• Role-based access: Super User, Collaborator, Auditor.  
• One-source-of-truth data model: data + evidence files tracked separately; progress bars for each.  
• KPI dashboards must show: Overall ESG score, E/S/G sub-scores, emissions trend, recommendations.  
• Reporting engine auto-fills DST, Green Key and generic ESG PDFs/XBRL.  
• Benchmarks card compares company KPIs to industry averages.

### 3. Platform & Breakpoints
Target desktop (≥1280 px), tablet (≥768 px) and mobile (≥360 px).  
Auto-layout rules:  
• Hero glass card stacks below headline < 960 px.  
• Bento cards reorder to single column < 600 px.

### 4. Visual Style & Design Tokens
• DARK GLASS HERO version: radial/linear gradient #131A2C → #1C1330, glassmorphic cards rgba(30,32,44,.24)+blur(12 px).  
• LIGHT BENTO version: ivory #FCFCF8 background, white cards, 1 px #E5E7EB stroke.  
• Brand colours: brand-green #2EC57D (Environment), brand-blue #3DAEFF (Social), brand-teal #20C5C5 (Governance).  
• Font family: Inter (700 for display, 400 for body).  
• Card radius 18 px (glass) / 12 px (bento); base spacing 8 px.  
• Motion: 150 ms cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1); respect prefers-reduced-motion.  
• All text/background pairs must hit 4.5 : 1 contrast in both modes.

### 5. Pages & Mandatory Components
1. **Landing / Home**  
   – Left: headline, sub-headline, “Request Demo” CTA.  
   – Right: glass KPI card or 4-tile bento grid (score, key metrics, emissions sparkline, recommendations list).

2. **Login / Request Demo** (modal).

3. **Dashboard (app/**)  
   – Overview tab (composite + E/S/G cards + trend + recs).  
   – Environment, Social, Governance detail tabs.  
   – Targets & Scenario card.

4. **Data-Wizard**  
   – Stepper sidebar (Business Info, Locations, Metrics, Evidence).  
   – Inline progress indicators, file-drop zones.

5. **Progress Tracker**  
   – Dual bars: Data entered %, Evidence uploaded %.

6. **Reports Hub**  
   – ESG, DST, Green Key, Custom Export tiles.

7. **Benchmarks**  
   – Industry comparison graphs, quartile badges.

8. **User Management**  
   – Tables for users & roles, invite modal, audit log.

9. **Audit Workspace** (read-only dashboards + evidence list).

10. **Settings**  
    – Framework selector (Hospitality, Construction, Logistics, Generic).  
    – Emission-factor overrides, API integrations (DEWA, SIWA, accounting).

Deliver wireframes + high-fidelity screens for each page in both dark-glass and light-bento themes. Include micro-interaction specs (hover elevation, gauge fill animation) and export design-token JSON.
